## GraphML to Mapping Verification Tool

<p align='justify'>This repository contains a Python tool for verifying the mapping between nodes and edges in GraphML files and mapping tables represented in CSV files. The tool automates the process of comparing nodes and edges between GraphML representations and mapping tables, providing insights into the consistency and correctness of mappings across different platforms.</p>

## Features:

Node and Edge Verification: Automatically checks if all nodes and edges in GraphML files are correctly mapped in the corresponding mapping tables.

CSV Parsing: Parses CSV files to extract mapping information for nodes and edges.

GraphML Parsing: Parses GraphML files to extract node and edge information for comparison.

Platform Support: Supports verification for multiple platforms, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
